These are the instruction for reviewers to download the new MAJIQ implementation included in the paper “Outlier detection for improved differential splicing quantification from RNA-Seq experiments with replicates”.

Download MAJIQ/VOILA requires an installation of Python Conda environment, once you have it installed use the following commands:

$ conda config --add channels bcbio
$ conda create -n majiq_env -c http://majiq.biociphers.org/download/channel majiq

linx-32/
linx-64/
osx-64/
win-32/

https://majiq.biociphers.org/download/channel/osx-64/

$ conda create -n majiq_env -c http://majiq.biociphers.org/download/channel/osx-64 majiq

conda create -n majiq_env -c http://majiq.biociphers.org/download/channel majiq
